- Feat: add several new patterns:
 1.predict_person_actions - takes a stream of text, devided into two sections of text, as input from the user, a psychological profile of a person, and b. a particular challenge. It then proceeds to predict how said person is most likely to react to such a challenge.
 2.fix_typos - takes a single stream of text as input from the user, proof-reads it, fixes all of the found typos, produces and returns a typo-free copy of the provided text.
 3.recommend_yoga_practice - meant to simulate a wise yogi, take input from the user, and provied a uniquely tailored yoga and meditation program for the user.
 4.model_as_sherlock_freud - assumes the role of a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Sigmond Freud, receives input from the user (text written by and/or about the subject) and constructs the most complete theoretical model of the subject's mind, including the subconsious, semi-conscious and conscious levels.
- Fix: slightly reorganized
